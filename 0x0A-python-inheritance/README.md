0. Beginning with simply listing all available attributes and methods of an object.
1. Printing and sorting an inherited list.
2. Check if an object is an instance of a specified class.
3. Check if an object is an instance of a class or an instance of a specified class or inherited from the specified class.
4. Checking if an object is an instance of a class inherited from a specified class.
5. Creating an empty BaseGeometry class that will be built upon.
6. Adding a public method to the BaseGeometry class.
7. Implementing another instance method and adding many test cases.
8. Implementing a class that inherits from BaseGeometry.
